# Your rule content
Always check first my backends/db.php, backends/main.php, backends/config.php, .htaccess, backends/*_management.php making any changes to the code block
Avoid duplicates, do not add the same code block again
Always refer to the current sql/db.sql file before making or changing any database queries, as it reflects my current database schem.
Whenever a change is necessary for the database, create db_suggested.sql file that includes the updated schema, ensure that the new file reflects the updated database schema
If there is no need to change the design, do not touch it and just focus in changing the logic on it.
Always use my modified log_error() to record errors, it can be used for debugging or recording information
Always use my modified log_error(type="info") to record information
Always use my modified log_error(type="debug") to record debug information
When changing/updating the design, always make sure that it is mobile-responsive across all possible device and prioritize the main content
Do not create a query on my pages/, when there is a need to make a query, enclose it in a function and set the name as their usage
Centralize the functions as per their usage, save it to either to my db.php, main.php, or to my *_management.php files
components/header.php handles the header design and also with the navigation (sidebar and topbar)
components/footer.php handles the footer design and components/head.php handles the head design
When processing big chunks of data, break it into lower chunks before proceeding
When making changes to the database, always make sure to update the db_suggested.sql file
