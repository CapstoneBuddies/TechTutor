# Unit Testing Plan for Capstone-1 Project

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the approach for implementing unit tests for the Capstone-1 web application. Unit testing will help ensure individual components work correctly in isolation and identify bugs early in the development process.

## 2. Testing Framework Selection

For PHP applications, we recommend using:

- **PHPUnit**: The standard for PHP unit testing
- **Mockery**: For creating test doubles (mocks, stubs)
- **PHP_CodeCoverage**: To measure test coverage

## 3. Test Directory Structure

Create a `/tests` directory at the project root with the following structure:

```
/tests
  /Unit
    /Controllers
    /Models
    /Services
    /Helpers
  /Integration
  /Functional
  bootstrap.php
  phpunit.xml
```

## 4. Key Components to Test

Based on the project structure, focus testing on these core components:

### 4.1 User Authentication System
- User registration
- Login functionality
- Password reset
- Session management
- Access control

### 4.2 Course Management
- Course creation and modification
- Enrollment functionality
- Content delivery

### 4.3 Transaction Processing
- Payment handling
- Order creation
- Receipt generation

### 4.4 File Management
- Upload functionality
- File validation
- Storage management

## 5. Testing Approach

### 5.1 Unit Tests

Test individual classes and methods in isolation:
- Controllers: Test request handling and response generation
- Models: Test data validation, storage, and retrieval
- Services: Test business logic implementation
- Helpers: Test utility functions

### 5.2 Test Data Management

- Create fixture data for tests
- Use database transactions to roll back test data
- Implement factory patterns for test object creation

### 5.3 Mocking External Dependencies

- Database connections
- File system operations
- External API calls
- Email services

## 6. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup
1. Install PHPUnit and dependencies
2. Configure phpunit.xml
3. Create bootstrap file for test initialization

### Phase 2: Core Components
1. Write tests for authentication functionality
2. Implement tests for data models
3. Test core business logic services

### Phase 3: Auxiliary Systems
1. Test file handling functionality
2. Test notification systems
3. Test reporting features

### Phase 4: Integration
1. Implement integration tests between components
2. Test full user workflows

## 7. Sample Test Implementation

```php
<?php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class UserAuthenticationTest extends TestCase
{
    protected $userModel;
    
    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->userModel = new UserModel();
    }
    
    public function testUserRegistration()
    {
        $userData = [
            'username' => 'testuser',
            'email' => 'test@example.com',
            'password' => 'SecurePassword123',
            'role' => 'student'
        ];
        
        $result = $this->userModel->register($userData);
        $this->assertTrue($result);
        
        // Verify user exists in database
        $user = $this->userModel->findByEmail('test@example.com');
        $this->assertNotNull($user);
        $this->assertEquals('testuser', $user->username);
    }
    
    public function testInvalidRegistration()
    {
        $userData = [
            'username' => 'test',
            'email' => 'invalid-email',
            'password' => 'short',
            'role' => 'student'
        ];
        
        $result = $this->userModel->register($userData);
        $this->assertFalse($result);
        
        // Check validation errors
        $errors = $this->userModel->getErrors();
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('email', $errors);
        $this->assertArrayHasKey('password', $errors);
    }
    
    // Additional tests for login, password reset, etc.
}
```

## 8. Code Coverage Goals

- Initial goal: 50% code coverage
- Target: 75% code coverage
- Stretch goal: 90% coverage for critical components

## 9. Continuous Integration

Integrate unit tests into the CI/CD pipeline:
- Run tests on each commit
- Block merges if tests fail
- Generate and publish coverage reports

## 10. Maintenance

- Review and update tests as features change
- Add tests for bug fixes to prevent regression
- Schedule periodic review of test coverage

## 11. Resource Requirements

- Developer time: Initially 20% of development effort
- Ongoing maintenance: 10% of development effort
- Testing environment setup and maintenance
