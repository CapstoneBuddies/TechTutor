### Example Scenario:

Allan, a tutor that uses our system, wants to share his knowledge about Python Programming. Allan proceeds to set a tutoring session from March 20, 2025, up until April 12, 2025. As Allan is a working adult, he sets the available schedule for the tutoring class on Monday to Friday, every 1 PM–3 PM, 8 PM–10 PM, and on Saturdays at 9 AM–12 PM.

Trisha, who is a 3rd-year college student, is having trouble catching up with her class on Python programming. She came upon our platform and found Allan, who set an online tutoring session for Python. She immediately booked his service and set her tutoring class on MWF at 1 PM–3 PM, as her break time starts at 12:30 PM–5 PM.

With the help of Allan, Trisha was able to pass her Python class with flying colors.
