Always apply the rules
Always follow my curent setup for file arrangement
For database related actions, always refer to my @/sql/db.sql file for the database schema
Do not attempt to update my @/sql/db.sql but instead save it to my @/sql/db_suggestion.sql
Always check and verify first with my @/.htaccess , @/backends/config.php , and @/backends/main.php before making changes
